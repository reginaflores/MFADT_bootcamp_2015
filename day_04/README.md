HOMEWORK:

 Create a simple "GUI" (Graphical User Interface) - in other words, a sketch that has onscreen buttons and/or instructions for user interaction. 
 
 Examples of GUIs include everything from the screen you're looking at right now to painting/photo editing programs to smartphone apps to gaming "HUDs" (Heads-up displays) to touchscreen ATMs.
 
 The GUI you create should enable users to interact with or change your sketch in some way. The simplest GUI would be a set of buttons users could click to control the wave animations we made today (in the sine functions example). BUT you should do something at least a little bit more creative!
