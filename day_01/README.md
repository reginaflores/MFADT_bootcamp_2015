### DAY 1

##Key Concepts

This is the live-coding project for Day 1 of Code: Champion, from Parks & Rec, made from simple shapes

The first version is made without variables, then in the second, super-simple variables for color and the midpoint of the canvas are created (all the shapes build off these two points)

If you have any ideas for other variables that would be helpful/easier, let me know. Short of making a variable for each X and Y position for each of the shapes, which is completely possible but not really necessary with how the shapes are drawn... it might be clearer, though, with how variables are usually used. Let me know!

##Homework:
*REVIEW ALL THE THINGS

*make SOMETHING COOL

*Draw a scene or character using what we learned in class.

*Bonus

INTERACTIVE & CHANGING OVER TIME

Doing both may or may not get you a prize. 

You should absolutely do one.
